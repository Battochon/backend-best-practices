# RateMyBackend: Backend General Best Practices

## Status

This is a early stage of this calculator. Do not be formal with the look & feel. This is only a work of 5 to 6 hours. The is just the base to discuss mostly about the best practices to add/modify/delete. Any pull request will be welcomed. I'm not a backend guru, that's why any help is welcome.

## Aim of this application

This application aims to rate easly a backend, mostly aimed at API (REST) Backend. No micro-servcies, for example, even if most of best practices should apply.

## What needs to be done yet

* Present results in a comprehensive way
* Best practices labels are not definitive, I wrote them watching netflix more like a notebook
* Add description to each best practices
* Give hints to each best practice
* Lot more but its late

## Background

English is not my mother tongue, so sorry for all misspellings first.
I'm a developer for about 19 years now (usually fullstack with a bit more experience in frontend) and I was just amazed recently to see, in my current position, so pourly developed and architectured API (for various reasons). I searched for a way to "score a backend" to prove what I was thinking in a factual maner. I found nothing and thought about some kind of "rate a backend way" based only on general best practices according to the open source community.

## Why is the frontend so ugly

This was more like a challenge to me. I wanted to test my basics, without any framework, to see if I can be productive, just with a code editor and an HTML page. I checked also for static site generators and found each of them to be way too complicated for this simple task.
